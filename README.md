# Summary

UD Tswana-Popapolelo is a translation of the 20 Cairo Cicling sentences (https://github.com/UniversalDependencies/cairo) annotated with XPOS, UPOS and dependency relations.

# Introduction

There are 20 translated sentences with a total of 234 tokens.

The entire treebank is labeled as test set due to its size. 
If it is used for training in future research, the users should employ ten-fold 
cross-validation.

# Acknowledgments
Translations and initial annotations performed by Ansu Berg, Rigardt Pretorius, Kevin Mavalela, and Kaboentle
Maibi.

# POS Annotation
Automatic annotation was done with the NCHLT processing tools (https://hlt.nwu.ac.za/) and corrected manually. UPOS was automatically converted from the XPOS. The XPOS tags contain richer part-of-speech information for Tswana, e.g. class information, and are based on the NCHLT tag set (https://hdl.handle.net/20.500.12185/7).
